This is libmemtie, a simple API for tied heap storage.

What is tied heap storage? It's heap storage which is freed
automatically when some other object, which need not be heap-allocated,
is deallocated. In particular, you can tie heap storage to stack frames,
meaning the heap chunk will be freed when the stack frame's allocating
function is deallocated.

It is highly experimental, incomplete, and other things. 

Nevertheless, it is useful in both the DwarfPython and Cake runtimes --
these are other projects of mine.

It builds on two other libraries: libdwarfpp and libpmirror. These are
also on my GitHub pages <http://github.com/stephenrkell/>. It also uses
my malloc hooks, available from
<http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/stephen.kell/>.
